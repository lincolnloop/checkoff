# Checkoff

## Project Setup

From the root project directory:

    $ npm install -g grunt-cli
    $ npm install
    $ grunt

This fires up a static server that offers up 'static/index.html' file, or
delivers static files with common file extensions defined in the Gruntfile. It
will watch for changes and automatically reload the site in the browser,
without needing you to hit "refresh".
